You can access the app at http://localhost:8080/clubs

The databse for the app is "SpringMVC" from locally installed Postgres DB.

you can register a new user, or login with an existing one like
    user    "test"
    pass    "test"

users can create their own running clubs, for which they can also create events.
other users can only see clubs/events created by the initial user.
